# ruby-enterprise-scripts

Sample Ruby scripts for making request to the Twitter Enterprise APIs. These are intended to be simple and easy-to-use scripts for anyone familiar with Ruby and may be helpful building blocks for building your own custom code to integrate with the APIs.

## Dependencies

- Ruby (recommended: >= 2.0.0)
- A Twitter Enterprise API Account (e.g., console.gnip.com access)
- Ability to execute Ruby scripts (e.g., command line, IDE, etc.)

## Supported APIs

API products that are currently supported by this collection of scripts (click product name to jump to that section of README):

1. [PowerTrack](#powertrack) - Filter realtime Tweets ([link to docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/overview))
2. [Decahose](#decahose) - Sample realtime Tweets ([link to docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/decahose-api/overview/decahose))
3. [Historical PowerTrack](#historical-powertrack) - Get batch historical Tweets ([link to docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/historical-powertrack-api/overview))
4. [Search API](#search-api) - 30-Day and Full-Archve products to Search for Tweets ([link to docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/search-api/overview))

## Authorization and Authentication

These scripts are part of our paid, Enterprise tier of API offerings. In order to make use of the scripts, you must have authorization to access the Enterprise APIs as part of a "trial" or ongoing contractual basis. If you have access to the [Gnip console](console.gnip.com) and one or more of the APIs listed above, then you have the correct level of access. Otherwise, you can [apply for access here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/enterprise/application).

The supported APIs require `basic authentication`, using the username and password that you currently use to login to your Gnip console (console.gnip.com). The scripts provided suggest setting your username and password as environment variables, but allow for variable assignment of your creds and account details directly in the script itself.

## Configuration

Each script requires you to input some basic information about your account and the API endpoint. For example, the account-level details  required are (found at the top of the script):

```
username = "name@example.com"
password = "your-password"
account_name = "CompanyName" # cannot contain spaces
```

There's also the notion of a `stream_label` or `endpoint_label` depending on the the API. This will be set by your account representative when your account is created and is normally `prod` or `dev`. Here's an example below using the PowerTrack API:

```
stream_label = "prod"
```

NOTE: The API-specific instructions below assume that you've set you account-level details as environment variables *or* will set them directly in each script.

## PowerTrack

This streaming API enables you to filter the full Twitter firehose in realtime.

### Add a rule
Add a rule to your stream so that it will return matched Tweets when you connect to the stream:

1. Assign your `stream_label` value (defaults to `prod`) in the `add_rule.rb` file.
2. Add your rule to the `rule_value` variable in the script.
3. Run:

```shell
$ ruby add_rule.rb
```

### List rules

Make a get request to list all rules on your stream: Run:

```shell
$ ruby list_rules.rb
```

### Connect to the stream

Make a get request to the stream endpoint to begin streaming Tweets. Run:

```shell
$ ruby get_stream.rb
```

### Delete rules

Deletes a rule from your stream.

1. Find the rule ID of the rule you want to delete (included in response from list_rules.rb)
2. Add the rule ID to the array of rule_ids in the script
3. Run:

```shell
$ ruby delete_rule.rb
```

## Decahose

The only method supported with the Decahose API is a GET request to connect to the stream endpoint. Run:

```shell
$ ruby get_decahose.rb
```

## Historical PowerTrack

This is a job-based API that provides filtered access to the entire archive of publicly available Tweets.

### Create a job

This will create a new Historical PowerTrack job.

1. Enter your HPT job parameters (example provided in script):

```shell
data_format = "original"
from_date = "201803010000"
to_date = "201804010000"
title = "twitterdev-job"
rules =[ {"value": "from:twitterdev", "tag": "twitterdev"}]
```

2. Run:

```shell
$ ruby create_job.rb
```

### Get job status

After a job is created, you can use this request to monitor the current status of the specific job.

1. Assign the `job_uuid` variable to your job UUID (e.g., eky8nws010). Your job UUID can be found in the `jobURL` field of a successful POST request when creating a job (the step above).

2. Run:

```shell
$ ruby get_job_status.rb
```

### Accept a job

Once the estimate has completed, you can accept the job to begin the process of retrieving the data.

1. Assign the `job_uuid` variable to your job UUID (e.g., eky8nws010)
2. Run:

```shell
$ ruby accept_job.rb
```

### Reject a job

Once the estimate has completed, you can reject the job if you don't want to retrieve the data.

1. Assign the `job_uuid` variable to your job UUID (e.g., eky8nws010)
2. Run:

```shell
$ ruby reject_job.rb
```

### Get results for a job

Retrieves info about a completed HPT job, including a list of URLs which correspond to the data files generated for a completed job. These URLs will be used to download the Twitter data files.

1. Assign the `job_uuid` variable to your job UUID (e.g., eky8nws010)
2. Run:

```shell
$ ruby get_results.rb
```

### List active jobs

Lists details for all HPT jobs that are not expired. Run:

```shell
$ ruby list_active_jobs.rb
```

## Search API

The Search API is a RESTful API that supports one query (up to 2048 characters) per request and paginates through the full request to deliver all matched Tweets. There are two levels of available archive access – 30-Day or Full-Archive – and it has two endpoints: 1) Search endpoint (retrieve Tweet payloads) 2) Counts endpoint (retrieves volume associated with your query)

### Search request (data)

1. Assign your `endpoint_label` value (defaults to `prod`) in the `search_request.rb` file.
2. Set the `archive` variable to your correct product access ('30Day' or 'fullarchive')
3. Enter your Search parameters (example provided in script):

```shell
rule = "from:twitterdev OR @twitterdev"
from_date = "201803010000"
to_date = "201803312359"
max_results = 500
```

4. Run:

```shell
$ ruby search_request.rb
```

### Counts request (volume)

1. Assign your `endpoint_label` value (defaults to `prod`) in the `counts_request.rb` file.
2. Set the `archive` variable to your correct product access ('30Day' or 'fullarchive')
3. Enter your Search counts parameters (example provided in script):

```shell
rule = "from:twitterdev OR @twitterdev"
from_date = "201803010000"
to_date = "201803312359"
bucket = "day"
```

4. Run:

```shell
$ ruby counts_request.rb
```
